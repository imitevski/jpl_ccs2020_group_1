### Variables:
-- `rlut`: TOA Outgoing Longwave Radiation
-- `rsdt`: TOA Incident Shortwave Radiation
-- `rsut`: TOA Outgoing Shortwave Radiation

### Questions to answer:

1. Global warming is a consequence of an energy imbalance: more shortwave radiation absorbed at the top of the atmosphere
(TOA) than re-emitted longwave and reflected shortwave. Calculate the global net radiative flux imbalance at the top of the
atmosphere (TOA). How does this compare with published estimates? How has this number changed through time? Note:
when spatially averaging TOA fluxes, make sure you consider the fact that mapped grid cell areas change as a function of
latitude.

2. If Earth’s radiative flux imbalance were entirely absorbed in the troposphere (assume the lower 10 km of atmosphere), what
would be the average annual increase in GMSAT? How does your predicted temperature change compare to the actual change
through time? Note: atmospheric density decreases with height

3. Repeat all parts of question (2) but instead consider that the entire radiative flux imbalance warms the upper 10 m, 100 m, 700
m, and 2000 m of the global ocean, respectively. Compare the predicted temperature changes against observations by using
AMSRE SST data as a proxy for the upper 10 m ocean temperature, and ARGO data for the upper 100, 700 and 2000 m. How do
the actual warming trends of each of these depth categories compare against predictions?

4. Divide the ocean into 4 basins: Pacific, Indian, Atlantic, and Southern Oceans. Which basins and which depths account for the
greatest observed warming?

5. Compare the year-to-year variations in GMSAT over the past 30 years with variations in the annual mean SST for each of the
basins in Question 4. Which basin’s SST is the most correlated with GMSAT?
